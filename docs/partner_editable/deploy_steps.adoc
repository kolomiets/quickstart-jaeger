// We need to work around Step numbers here if we are going to potentially exclude the AMI subscription

=== Sign in to your AWS account

. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For more information, see
//TODO Planning_the_deployment anchor link does not resolve.
 link:#planning-the-deployment[Planning the deployment], earlier in this guide.
. Ensure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the
//TODO Technical_requirements anchor link does not resolve.
 link:#technical-requirements[Technical requirements] section.
. Use the Region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want to deploy Amazon EKS.
. Select the key pair that you created earlier. In the navigation pane of the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2 console^], choose *Key Pairs*, and then choose your key pair from the list.


// Optional based on Marketplace listing. Not to be edited

=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-name} AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. {marketplace_listing_url}[Open the page for the {partner-product-name} AMI in AWS Marketplace], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].

. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action.

IMPORTANT: Do not provision the software from AWS Marketplace—the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

=== Launch the Quick Start

. Optionally, if you want to configure advanced parameters, launch the https://fwd.aws/6dEQ7[advanced configuration template^].
. Choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template into your AWS account. For help with choosing an option, see link:#_deployment_options[Deployment options], earlier in this guide.

|===
Deployment can take between {deployment_time} to complete, depending on the chosen deployment option and parameter values.

NOTE: If you deploy Amazon EKS into an existing VPC, ensure that your VPC has private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances. The subnets require egress internet access using a NAT gateway or an HTTP proxy. If you want to use the Kubernetes integration with Elastic Load Balancing, you must tag each private subnet with `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb=true` and each public subnet with `kubernetes.io/role/elb=true`.

. Check the Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This is where the network infrastructure for Amazon EKS is built. The template launches in the US East (Ohio) Region by default.

NOTE: Some services are not supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/eks.html[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service endpoints and quotas^].

[start=4]
. On the *Select template* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template, and provide values for any parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings, and customize them as necessary.

NOTE: If Amazon EKS is already deployed in your account, ensure that the `Per account shared resources` parameter is set to *No*. If you deploy a new Amazon EKS instance in the same Region as a previously deployed instance, set `Per region shared resources` to *No*.

NOTE: If you created and intend to use an advanced configuration stack, ensure that you set the value for `Config set name` to match the value you used when you launched the advanced configuration stack.

NOTE: Unless you are customizing this Quick Start's templates for your own deployment projects, we recommend that you keep the default settings for the parameters labeled `Quick Start S3 bucket name`, `Quick Start S3 bucket
Region`, and `Quick Start S3 key prefix`. Changing these parameter settings automatically updates code references to point to a new Quick Start location. For more information, see the https://aws-quickstart.github.io/option1.html[AWS Quick Start Contributor’s Guide^].

[start=6]
. On the *Configure stack options* page, you can https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html[specify tags^] (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html[set advanced options^]. When you’re done, choose *Next*.
. On the *Review* page, review and confirm the template settings. Under *Capabilities*, select the two check boxes to acknowledge that the template creates IAM resources and might require the ability to automatically expand macros.
. Choose *Create stack* to deploy the stack.
ifndef::partner-product-short-name[. Monitor the status of the stack. When the status is *CREATE_COMPLETE*, the {partner-product-name} deployment is ready.]
ifdef::partner-product-short-name[. Monitor the status of the stack. When the status is *CREATE_COMPLETE*, the {partner-product-short-name} deployment is ready.]
. Use the values displayed in the *Outputs* tab for the stack, as shown in <<cfn_outputs>>, to view the created resources.
