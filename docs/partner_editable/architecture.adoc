As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*

In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.
* <describe any additional components>.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.

=== Storage Backend
Jaeger supports multiple options for https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/deployment/#storage-backends[persisted storage backends].
This Quick Start supports the following backend options:

* *Elasticsearch* - production-ready storage backend, recommended for large scale production deployments by the Jaeger team.
* *In-memory* storage - the in-memory storage is not intended for production workloads. 
Itâ€™s intended as a simple solution to get started quickly and data will be lost once the process is gone.

See the following sections for details on target AWS architecture that this Quick Start deploys, 
depending on the storage type selected.

==== Elasticsearch storage backend architecture

[#img-elasticsearch-architecture]
.Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS with Elasticsearch backend
image::architecture_elasticsearch_diagram.png[Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS with Elasticsearch backend]

Elasticsearch storage backend is the recommended option for large scale production Jaeger deployments.
The Quick Start exposes a number of parameters to provision an Elasticsearch cluster adjusted for your needs - 
see link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] for additional details. 

With all the optional integrations disabled, the following components are deployed:

* https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/[Amazon OpenSearch] cluster 
* https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/[ECS Fargate] cluster   
* ECS Service for https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#collector[Jaeger Collector service]. The service runs tasks
distributed across multiple Availability Zones and distributes traffic between them
* ECS Service for https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#query[Jaeger Query service]. The service runs tasks
distributed across multiple Availability Zones and distributes traffic between them
* ECS Task, triggered according to provided cron schedule (once a day, by default). The purpose of the job is to build the connection
graph between services, based on the collected traces. See https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/faq/#why-is-the-dependencies-page-empty[
Jaeger documentation] for additional details on this job.
* Network Load Balancer that exposes https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#query[Jaeger Query service] to the clients

==== In-memory storage backend architecture

[#img-memory-architecture]
.Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS with In-memory backend
image::architecture_memory_diagram.png[Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS with In-memory backend]

Jaeger deployed with in-memory storage is *not* highly available / resilient. As in-memory storage can't be shared between
containers, there is only one Jaeger ECS task running at any given moment of time. If the task is terminated, all traces 
are lost.

This is the simplest Jaeger deployment on AWS this Quick Start provides. With all the optional integrations disabled,
the following components are deployed:

* ECS Fargate cluster
* ECS Service that runs a single Jaeger task using [https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/deployment/#all-in-one]all-in-one Jaeger distribution
* Network Load Balancer that exposes https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#query[Jaeger Query service] to the clients    

In-memory storage backend is ideal for rapid prototyping, proof of concept work, experimentation, etc. 

=== DNS configuration
Jaeger can be deployed in multiple different ways, depending on the networking requirments. This Quick Start
provides a number of configuration parameters to accomodate different scenarious. The following sections
provide additional information on different network topologies.

==== Network Load Balancer visibility
By default: *internet-facing*

Network Load Balancer can be provisioned as `internet-facing` 
(with a public IP address) or as `internal` (accessible only from within VPC). 

Network load balancer sits in front of ECS services and exposes a number of ports for the clients:

[cols="1,1,3"]

^| *Port* ^| *Protocol* ^| *Description*
^.^|*14250*

^.^|*80* / *443*
^.^| HTTP 
| Jaeger UI at `/` and API endpoints at `/api/*`
|===

NOTE: The load balancer is provisioned in *public* VPC subnets (public here does not necessarily mean 
that it is publicly accessible) in contrast to the other Jaeger services 
(ECS services and tasks, Elasticseatch cluster) that run in *private* VPC subnets.

==== Public DNS
By default: *disabled*

An optional public DNS name can be configured for the load balancer - this would make it possible 
to use a custom domain name, like `jaeger.mydoman.com`. This Quick Start can create a Roure 53 record
in a public hosted zone to support this scenario. There are several ways to achieve this:

- use an existing Route 53 public hosted zone - 
you can provide the hosted zone ID as a parameter for the Quickstart
- create a new public hosted zone and provision Jaeger DNS record there. 

NOTE: This Quick Start does not set up subdomain delegation (NS records). 
If you requested a new hosted zone for a subdomain, you would need to configure the delegation.

==== Private DNS
By default: *disabled*

An optional private DNS name can be configured for the load balancer and associated with the VPC - 
this would make it possible to use a custom domain name, like jaeger.mydoman.com from within your VPC. 
Usually, this makes sense when an internal load balancer is used.

This Quick Start can create a Roure 53 record in a private hosted zone to support this scenario. 
There are several ways to achieve this:

- use an existing Route 53 private hosted zone - 
you can provide the hosted zone ID as a parameter for the Quickstart
- create a new private hosted zone and provision Jaeger DNS record there. 

NOTE: This Quick Start does not set up subdomain delegation (NS records). 
If you requested a new hosted zone for a subdomain, you would need to configure the delegation.

==== TLS certificates
By default: *disabled*

Prerequisite: Public DNS has to be configured

An optional TLS certificate can be associated with the load balancer to enable encryption in transit for Jaeger clients. This is a highly recommended setup.

The Quick Start provides multiple options to enable the encryption:

- use an existing ACM certificate - you can provide an ARN for the certificate as a parameter for the Quick Start
- create new ACM certificate and associate it with the load balancer. 

WARNING: If a new certificate is requested, the Quick Start performs DNS validation,
i.e. validation of DNS CNAME record created in a public hosted zone. If ACM can't validate the record,
the Quick Start deployment will eventually fail. Keep this in mind if your hosted zone is not 
internet-reachable (this may be the case when you requested a new public zone for a subdomain 
but DNS delegation is not configured yet).

=== Container Insights integration
By default: *disabled*

=== Exporting Jaeger metrics
By default: *disabled*

Jaeger services expose Prometheus metrics that may be useful to assess the health of the telemetry backend. 
The Quick Start can be optionally configured to expose these metrics and export them to 
https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/[Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus] (AMS). 
This is achieved by deploying an ECS Service with ADOT collector that scrapes the metrics from 
Jaeger services and pushes them to AMS. You can configure the QuickStart to:

- use an existing AMS workspace for export - you can provide an ARN for the workspace as a parameter for the Quick Start
- create a new workspace

Further, if metrics export is enabled, additional AWS-specific metrics from ECS cluster are exported to AWS CloudWatch:

- `ecs.task.memory.utilized`
- `ecs.task.memory.reserved`
- `ecs.task.cpu.utilized`
- `ecs.task.cpu.reserved`
- `ecs.task.network.rate.rx`
- `ecs.task.network.rate.tx`
- `ecs.task.storage.read_bytes`
- `ecs.task.storage.write_bytes`
