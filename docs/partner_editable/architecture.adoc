Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
*default parameters* builds the following _{partner-product-name}_ environment in the
AWS Cloud.

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*

In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.
* <describe any additional components>.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.

=== Storage Backend
Jaeger supports multiple options for https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/deployment/#storage-backends[persisted storage backends].
This Quick Start supports the following backend options:

* *Elasticsearch* - production-ready storage backend, recommended for large scale production deployments by the Jaeger team.
* *In-memory* storage - the in-memory storage is not intended for production workloads. 
Itâ€™s intended as a simple solution to get started quickly and data will be lost once the process is gone.

See the following sections for details on target AWS architecture that this Quick Start deploys, 
depending on the storage type selected.

==== Elasticsearch storage backend architecture

[#img-elasticsearch-architecture]
.Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS with Elasticsearch backend

Elasticsearch storage backend is the recommended option for large scale production Jaeger deployments.
The Quick Start exposes a number of parameters to provision an Elasticsearch cluster adjusted for your needs - 
see link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] for additional details. 

With all the optional components disabled, the following components are deployed:

* https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/[Amazon OpenSearch] cluster 
* https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/[ECS Fargate] cluster   
* ECS Service for https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#collector[Jaeger Collector service]. The service runs tasks
distributed across multiple Availability Zones and distributes traffic between them
* ECS Service for https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#query[Jaeger Query service]. The service runs tasks
distributed across multiple Availability Zones and distributes traffic between them
* ECS Task, triggered according to provided cron schedule (once a day, by default). The purpose of the job is to build the connection
graph between services, based on the collected traces. See https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/faq/#why-is-the-dependencies-page-empty[
Jaeger documentation] for additional details on this job.
* Network Load Balancer that exposes https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#query[Jaeger Query service] to the clients

==== In-memory storage backend architecture

[#img-memory-architecture]
.Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS with In-memory backend
image::architecture_memory_diagram.png[Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS with In-memory backend]

Jaeger deployed with in-memory storage is *not* highly available / resilient. As in-memory storage can't be shared between
containers, there is only one Jaeger ECS task running at any given moment of time. If the task is terminated, all traces 
are lost.

This is the simplest Jaeger deployment on AWS this Quick Start provides. With all the optional components disabled,
the following components are deployed:

* ECS Fargate cluster
* ECS Service that runs a single Jaeger task using [https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/deployment/#all-in-one]all-in-one Jaeger distribution
* Network Load Balancer that exposes https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.32/architecture/#query[Jaeger Query service] to the clients    

In-memory storage backend is ideal for rapid prototyping, proof of concept work, experimentation, etc.
