This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] on the AWS Cloud.

Jaeger, inspired by https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html[Dapper] and https://zipkin.io/[OpenZipkin], 
is a distributed tracing platform created by https://uber.github.io/[Uber Technologies] and donated to 
https://cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]. It can be used for monitoring microservices-based distributed systems:

* Distributed context propagation
* Distributed transaction monitoring
* Root cause analysis
* Service dependency analysis
* Performance / latency optimization

This Quick Start helps you to deploy a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/high-availability-and-scalability-on-aws.html[highly available] Jaeger - open source, end-to-end 
distributed tracing backend on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy Jaeger 
in your AWS account in about 10-30 minutes. The Quick Start automates the following (see link:#_deployment_options[Deployment options]):

* **Deploying Jaeger into a new VPC**
* **Deploying Jaeger into an existing VPC**

This Quick Start is for users who want a repeatable, customizable reference deployment 
for Jaeger using https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation].

You can also use the provided AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
