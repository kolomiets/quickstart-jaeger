This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] on the AWS Cloud.

Jaeger, inspired by https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html[Dapper] and https://zipkin.io/[OpenZipkin], 
is a distributed tracing platform created by https://uber.github.io/[Uber Technologies] and donated to 
https://cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]. It can be used for monitoring microservices-based distributed systems:
* Distributed context propagation
* Distributed transaction monitoring
* Root cause analysis
* Service dependency analysis
* Performance / latency optimization

This Quick Start is for users who want a repeatable, customizable reference deployment for Jaeger using AWS CloudFormation.
